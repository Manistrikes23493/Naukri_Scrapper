Roles and Responsibilities
Introduction
Quantum computers are incredibly powerful machines that take a new approach to processing information. Built on the principles of quantum mechanics, they exploit complex and fascinating laws of nature that are always there, but usually remain hidden from view. By harnessing such natural behavior, quantum computers can run new types of algorithms to process information more holistically. They may one day lead to revolutionary breakthroughs in materials and drug discovery, the optimization of complex manmade systems, and artificial intelligence. We expect them to open doors that we once thought would remain locked indefinitely.

 Job Description 
 
 
 
 Who are we: 
 
 
 POP Implementation team part of Physical Design Group(PDG) at Arm Bangalore. 
 
 POP team is an experience to see the bigger picture of technical, business and problem solving aspects through the journey of building Arm CPU, GPU, NPU and Interconnect implementations. So what are the aspects we touch upon a daily basis
 
 
 Physical implementation of Arm s latest CPU, GPU, NPU and Interconnect IP. 
 
 
 
 Exposure to advanced and mainstream technology nodes(3nm/5nm/7nm/12nm/22nm) being driven by multiple foundries. 
 
 
 
 Path-finding for Performance, Power and Area(PPA) metrics using varied recipes along with backend closure that s representative of a tape-out. 
 
 
 
 Implementation flow and PPA tuning across multiple vendor based EDA flows in parallel. 
 
 
 
 Collaborating with Arm sales, marketing and end customers to refine the physical IP and implementation products. 
 
 
 
 Contribute in brainstorming ideas, approaches and recipes on all products being designed in the team. 
 
 
 
 Learn the intricacies of supporting products across different market segments like Client, Infrastructure, Automotive, IOT and Machine Learning. 
 
 
 
 Celebrate with the team to rejuvenate the mind and spirit for accomplishing greater things in future. 
 
 
 
 What you'll be doing: 
 
 
 
 You will be expected to build implementations of Arm CPU/GPU class designs using Arm s optimized physical IP. 
 
 
 
 You will need to setup RTL, integrate memory models, create floorplans, setup synthesis / PR flow and complete backend closure. 
 
 
 
 The primary objective would be to optimize performance, power and area as required by the Arm IP and the associated market segment. 
 
 
 
 In terms of backend closure, you will need to take the design through STA, EM, IR drop, signoff DRC and other types of verification steps. 
 
 
 
 You will also need to work on lighter aspects related to DFT(scan insertion, compression and ATPG) and setup Gate-level simulations to report power. 
 
 
 
 Your daily job will demand a lot of handshaking with physical IP teams who are responsible for optimized standard cell and memories.
